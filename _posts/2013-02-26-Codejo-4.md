For the fourth Codejo, we'll be looking again at the [Minesweeper Kata](kata/Minesweeper) in Ruby. Again we'll focus on Test Driven Development, following the stages:

* Red - failing test
* Green - make test pass as simply as possible
* Refactor - improve and clarify the code

But this time we'll start off pairing, as we got too carried away last time with the Randori.
