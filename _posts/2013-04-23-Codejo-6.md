For the sixth Codejo, we'll be looking again at the [Minesweeper Kata](kata/Minesweeper). 

This time we'll run another [Class-Responsibility-Collaborator (CRC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-responsibility-collaboration_card) session on the problem and focus upon a 'tell don't ask' (AKA no getters and setters) approach.

If we have time we'll have another run at the problem in pairs with Ruby. 
Ruby download instructions can be found [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

Don't forget your laptop and inquistive minds!
