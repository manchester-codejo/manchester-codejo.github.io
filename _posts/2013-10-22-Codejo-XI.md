It's our first birthday!  So, we're going to change language.  Goodbye Ruby and hellooo Javascript.

We'll stick with the [Checkout Kata](kata/Checkout) but this time in Javascript using nodejs.

I'll give a crash course in nodejs / javascript and then we'll split into pairs and attempt the kata.

Nodejs download instructions can be found [here](http://nodejs.org/download/).

Don't forget your laptop and inquistive minds!
