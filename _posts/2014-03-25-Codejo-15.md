For this months codejo we'll be running another [Class Responsibility Collaboration (CRC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-responsibility-collaboration_card) card session with the [Checkout Kata](kata/Checkout).

This is a way to look at candidate objects and their interactions without having the expense of making decisions in code.
