In 2014 there was a bit of a hiatus with Manchester Codejo as we decided what to do next.  We still wanted to provide a place for developers to hone their own skills, but we also wanted to start building links with the universities in the local area. 

There are three major universities inside the M60, and many others within an hours drive of Manchester, but the tech community is not great at engaging with the student community. So, in December we ran the first Manchester Codejo at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU).

We decided to start by looking at Ruby again with the Ruby Koans, which was done in pairs of one software professional with one student.  We will be continuing this again on the second codejo at MMU which is going to be held next Thursday (Thurs 22nd Jan), if you would like to be involved then please drop us a tweet **@manc_codejo**.
