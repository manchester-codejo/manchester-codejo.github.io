Katas are taken from the Japanese martial art practice of detailed choreographed patterns of movements practised either solo or in pairs. These katas are exercised at Dojos (training places) with the idea that the skills learned in the katas become second nature during a fight situation.

In a similar way we plan to use these katas to enhance our programming skills in the real world.
